# A Map of Weightlifting Gyms in Valencia

An interactive Web map where you can check if you can practise the sport of weightlifting in any gym of Valencia, and the price of a membership.

Made by Manuel Antonio Ortiz Mu√±iz.

## Data

All data is publicly accesible from Google.com.

For the location of the gyms I grabbed the lattitude and longitude of each one in google maps, and for the prices I checked them directly from the companies' websites. Keep in mind that these may change from time to time and I choosed the standard membership prices for all of them, except the cross-training type gyms, where I picked the unlimited access memberships so there is no limit for how many times a person can train a month.
