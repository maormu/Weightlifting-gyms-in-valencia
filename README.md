# A Map of Weightlifting Gyms in Valencia

An interactive Web map where you can check if you can practise the sport of weightlifting in any gym of Valencia, and the price of a membership.

Made by Manuel Antonio Ortiz Mu√±iz.

## Data

All data is publicly accesible from Google.com.

For the location of the gyms I grabbed the lattitude and longitude of each one in google maps, and for the prices I checked them directly from the companies' websites. Keep in mind that these may change from time to time and I choosed the standard membership prices for all of them, except the cross-training type gyms, where I picked the unlimited access memberships so there is no limit for how many times a person can train a month.

## Legend

When looking at the map, by default the first thing you see is dots with 3 different colors. Each dot represents a gym and you can check the name by hovering around them, and each color means:

Green: You can practise olympic Weightlifting

Yellow: You might practise olympic weightlifting but the main purpose of their installation is not meant for that (throwing weights to the floor, having a wooden platform in a very tight space, etc.).

Red: You can't practise olympic weightlifting by any means.

You can quickly choose which one of them you want to see by clicking on the list on the right of the page, on the words YES, NO, and YES BUT (this last one is for the yellow colored dots).

Now, if you hover in the top-right corner, you can see the second layer to this map, which is the monthly price of a subscription for each gym. This time the dots are size differentiated, where the price ranges are specified in the box where you can choose which layer to display. There is also a slide bar that lets you filter more quickly the price range you are looking for.

By clicking or hovering on top of a dot, you can read all the information cited above and also check the exact price of the membership of a specific gym.
